        <p>I avidly play league of legends. As of right now I am probably around platinum skill level, depending on the champion. <br />
           More recently I've been playing path of exile and been having fun with that, and playing some Rainbow Six: Siege which is also a pretty good game. <br />
           As for novels I am slowly working my way through the Wheel of Time series, which I've read half of but forgot where I was. I'm always looking for a good fantasy novel or interesting book. <br />
           In programming I am currently picking up golang and python concurrently, but I lack a decisive project I wish to commit time to. <br />
           In other news, cryptocurrencies continue to have a rocky trend of up and down, but I personally don't think that they're going anywhere anytime soon. As for who will be the victor when the dust settles, my money is on Ethereum.
