        <p> Projects that I am particularly proud of: <br />
            My stackcoin project. I had the opportunity to work with 3 wonderful partners to develop a web application with blockchain integration (Ethereum). While there are plenty of things we could have done better, I think that overall it was a great success. Unfortunately it is not hosted anywhere, and the azure machines the nodes were running on are offline now.
